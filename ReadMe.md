🎓 Pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Science and will graduate in mid-2023.

👨‍💻 I have mostly been focused on personal projects to better myself, but over the course of this year and years to come I hope to incrementally contribute to more open source projects. 

🎹 Outside the world of tech, my hobbies extend from piano, sketching, and soccer to the most important: Games 🎮.

📚 I am currently learning Machine Learning concepts using python, working with a team to create a full-stack project for a volunteer organization, and working as a mobile app developer
