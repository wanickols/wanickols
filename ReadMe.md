🎓 Graduated may 2023 with bachelors of Computer Science.

👨‍💻 I have mostly been focused on personal projects to better myself, but over the course of this year and years to come I hope to incrementally contribute to more open source projects. 

🎹 Outside the world of tech, my hobbies extend from piano, sketching, and soccer to the most important: Games 🎮.

📚 I am currently learning to use VR focusing on volumetric rendering tactics, working on a personal game, and trying to get experience through work.

## Concepts?
This is hard to write in a list form, as each topic could have varying levels of familiarty. So instead of just one word list, here are some qeustions and answers:

### Some common questions that I would answer yes to:
- Are you familiar with Object Oriented Programming? | Yes, I learned programming in college with C++, which taught me the principles of OOP such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- Have you ever worked with a full stack project? |  Yes, I have developed web applications using C# .NET framework, both hosted on Azure and self-hosted. I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the front-end, and ASP.NET MVC and Web API for the back-end.
-  Do you have experience with databases? | Yes, I have worked with SQL and MySQL databases for various projects. For example, I created a database-driven website intended to organzie residents and their stays for Salvation Army (This was non-commercial, but for Capstone).
- Are you familair with the AGILE methodology? | I am. I have been using it via JIRA for the past 2 years and while I am not a strong advocate for it, I could work in a team using it. 
### Some questions I'd clarify on
- Are you knowledgable on data structures and algorithims? | I am familiar with most data structures, and most of the more common algorithims. It's been years since I had to make one from scratch, so please don't waste our time. I know when to use them, but in general, I will do a bit of research to make sure I am not recreating something that already exists, and that I am using the optimal data structure or algorithim. I'd rather double check when needed than memorize them all.
