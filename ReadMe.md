# Hi there 👋 
## 😊 Who am I?

🎓 I am William Nickols. I am a student and an aspiring Software Engineer. I am Pursuing my Bachelor in Computer Science and will graduate in mid-2023.

👨‍💻 I have mostly been focused on personal projects to better myself, but over the course of this year and years to come I hope to incrementally contribute to more open source projects. 

🎹 Outside the world of tech, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies extend from Piano, sketching, and soccer to the most important: Games 🎮.

📚 I also love reading literary dystopian and adventures. My favorite ones are Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury of the genre of dystopian and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas by Jules Verne amongst the many adventures.

## 🚪 What is next?
### 📖 Learning 
🧑‍💻 I am always trying to learn! Focusing on higher-level language concepts such as algorithms, graphics API's like Vulcan and OpenGl,
Game Engines like Unreal and Unity, and anything else I can learn!
🏫 I am in school, so learning is a priority there too! My main goals are maintaining my 4.0 and branching out to meet and work with more people. 
### 🏠Home
👨‍👩‍👧 I have a lovely girlfriend and equally important family that I always make time for. 
❤️ Trying to better myself isn't limited to just knowledge, but I am also trying to eat better and be more mindful of my health. 
### 🌎 Life 
🌱 Personal growth is important to me. I try to learn new skills for work, but also because I want to be better each day. I apply 
this philosophy in all aspects of my life.
👔 My career is only one part of my life, but it is one I am giving serious thought to all the time. I want to enjoy what I do, and 
to do that I think a job that develops quickly and is challenging is a must. I expect when I apply for a job that I will be working 
there for years to come, and so I approach it as such.
